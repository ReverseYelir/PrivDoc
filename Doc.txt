How to execute script:
	1) Clone repo
	2) open windows enviroment variables (windows button + "edit enviroment")
	3) Find PATH under "Enviroment Variables", select it and click "Edit"
	4) In the new window labeled "edit enviroment variable", click "New" and paste in the your local absolute path to the repo (ex: C:\Users\User\PrivDoc)
	5) This allows PrivDoc.py to be called from any directory
	6) Ensure the default application for .py files is set to your python.exe installation

    ***NOTE***
    If you are having difficulties getting windows to pass along your command line arguments
    see this stack overflow post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2640971/windows-is-not-passing-command-line-arguments-to-python-programs-executed-from-t

Usage:
    encryption: PrivDoc.py -enc absolute_path
    decryption: PrivDoc.py -dec absolute_path n e d p q
